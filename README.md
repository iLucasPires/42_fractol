## Introduction

Fractol is a project that allows you to discover fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale. It will enable you to explore complex mathematical concepts, such as continuous and discrete, as well as to take a first look at the concept of optimization in computer graphics. You will also discover your first graphic library: miniLibX. This project introduces you to the basics of graphics programming, and in particular how to place points in space, how to join them with segments and most importantly how to observe the scene from a particular viewpoint.

## How to use
- Clone the repository
- Run `make` or `make bonus` to compile the project
